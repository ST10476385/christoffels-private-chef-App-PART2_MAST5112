## Overview
This project is a mobile application built with **React Native** and **Expo**. It showcases a restaurant menu with detailed dish descriptions, ingredients, chef’s stories, and pairing suggestions. Users can navigate through sections like starters, mains, desserts, wines, cocktails, and manage bookings and profiles.

The app is designed to be dynamic, allowing the chef to update the menu quickly for clients, ensuring that each dining experience is unique.
