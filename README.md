## Overview
This project is a mobile application built with **React Native** and **Expo**. It showcases a restaurant menu with detailed dish descriptions, ingredients, chef’s stories, and pairing suggestions. Users can navigate through sections like starters, mains, desserts, wines, cocktails, and manage bookings and profiles.

The app is designed to be dynamic, allowing the chef to update the menu quickly for clients, ensuring that each dining experience is unique.

### Notes

All Part 2 features are fully functional and dynamic

Menu items are temporarily stored in arrays; no persistent storage is used in Part 2

All screens are built using React Native core components and TypeScript for logic

The app is designed for Android devices, but Expo ensures cross-platform compatibility for future expansion to iOS
